# Blockwars

## How to get it running
This is how you do it: 
 * Build and run the game in Unity.
 	* For some reason the async socket communication won't work in Unity editor (has something to do with C# threading).
 	* File -> Build & Run -> Configure appropriate OS and architecture.
 	* Launch the game from the pop-up window.
 * Run main.py in Python 2.7.
 * For now the socket communication is configured for local running, which means that the game and the bot need to be run from the same computer.
 * You can play the game from the Twitch chat in twitch.tv/blockwars. Commands are "block 1", "block 2", etc.
